# Plan Day 10 (Week 2, Fri)

## Overall Key Objective
- Gain coding and assessment skills such that when you analyze a static *design comp*, you can build a web page using HTML and CSS that looks exactly like the comp.

Day 9 and 10 objectives differ:
- Day 9 objective was *synthesis* -- learn to code styles/layout.
- Today's objective is *analysis* -- "reverse engineer" a web page.
- Think: "Play new instrument" (synthesis) vs. "Figure out someone else's song" (analysis)
Both are important. Like writing code and reading someone else's code.
