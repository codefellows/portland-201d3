# Bus
This is one possible implementation of the "Bus Mall" web application described in [https://github.com/codefellows/portland-201d2/blob/master/week-3/Week3_lab.md] This app satisfies the "display 3 unique images for each vote" extra credit item, but omits styling, CSS transitions, and user instruction text content; this version focuses on JS logic, including logic for localStorage.
