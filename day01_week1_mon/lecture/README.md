  Run quick tests below to verify that all the main pieces of your development environment are working:
    - Atom: type `atom` in the command line to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed.
    - Atom packages: Be sure to have `linter`, `minimap`, and `open-in-browser` installed.
    - Chrome: open the console
    - Git: enter `which git` on the command line to verify installation
    - Folder structure: Set up a directory at ~/codefellows/201/ to store your classwork. Go over folder structure in general and compare to GUI.
