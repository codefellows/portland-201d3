  Run quick tests below to verify that all the main pieces of your development environment are working:
    - Atom: Type `atom` in **bash** to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed.
    - Atom packages: List installedpackages and verify you have `linter`, `minimap`, and `open-in-browser` installed.
    - Chrome: Open the console
    - Git: Enter `which git` in bash and verify installation
    - Folder structure: Create a folder such as ~/CF/201/ to store your labwork. Review folder structure in general and compare to GUI.

- Work on the [Day 01 lab](https://github.com/codefellows/portland-201d3/tree/master/day01_week1_mon/lab)
