### Verify Student Toolbelts
By doing a few quick tests and exercises, as detailed below, ensure that students have functionality of all of the core pieces of their development environment:
- Atom: type `atom` in the command line to verify that it opens properly. Command line tools may need to be installed.
- Atom packages: Be sure that they have linter, minimap,and  open-in-browser installed.
- Chrome: how to open the console
- Git: enter `which git` in the command line to verify installation
- Directory structure: Have students set up a directory at ~/codefellows/201/ in which they will store their classwork. Go over directory structure in general; compare to GUI.
