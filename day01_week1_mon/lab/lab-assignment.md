## Code 201
## Day 01 Lab Assignment

In lab today you will get a lot of practice working with the Terminal, Atom, Git, and GitHub. The goal is for you to have hands-on practice and to see how everything fits together.

This lab will reveal to us if there are any lingering problems with your computer setup, and we will get these remedied in lab.

At times the instructions will be very clear and direct, and at other times you'll be given a more general description of what to do, which is designed to help you move toward a place of figuring things out on your own and developing more independence as a software developer.

The Unix and Git slides we used in class yesterday are in this git repository. You can use them as a reference during lab today.

We'll also work on highlighting some common terminology. Those elements will be in ***bold italics*** *with definitions in italics*.

---
***terminal*** *- This is your file management system, called 'Terminal' in the Mac and 'git-bash' in Windows. In this document you'll see terminal commands formatted like this:* ```ls -la```

#### ALL FILE MANIPULATION IN THIS ASSIGNMENT MUST BE DONE USING YOUR TERMINAL!!! ALSO, TYPE ALL COMMANDS BY HAND! NO COPY-AND-PASTE!

***console*** *- This is the JavaScript console that you open in Chrome to inspect or work with the JS that in an HTML document*.

* Create a new GitHub repo for this course. Look at the instructions for creating a new repo that are found on page 18 of the "git intro slides" PDF in this repo. Give your new repo some kind of brief one-sentence description and initialize your repo with a README, and copy the URL for cloning as shown during lecture.

* In your terminal, enter the command `git clone [your repo name]` to clone your repo onto your laptop. Do `ls` in your terminal to see a new folder that has the same name as your new repo. Create a folder inside that folder for today's lab -- let "today's folder" denote this folder.

* Seek verification from a classmate or the teaching staff. Be sure you're set up correctly before proceeding.

* Copy index.html and app.js files from the 'demo0' folder of the class repo into today's folder.

* Create a README.md in today's folder.

* Copy index.html and script/app.js from [HERE](https://github.com/codefellows/portland-201d3/tree/master/day01_week1_mon/lecture/demo_QandA_calc) into your git workspace and customize the app by changing every string in app.js, and modify the DOM structure coded in index.html. If you have any time left after finishing this material, you can read the following two articles:
