# Help Procedure

If you encounter an issue while working on labs:
1. Look up information online, and sandbox unfamiliar coding features to understand how to use them. Read at least three web pages to try to find a solution.
- Debugging: Try, at a minimum, each of the following methods that are applicable to your situation; in some cases you may need to combine methods to effectively debug:
  . Do static analysis on your code - syntax, variable names, execution flow.
  . Use Chrome Developer Tools to set break points and single step through your code as it executes.
  . Add console.log() calls to your code and examine console output.
  . Comment out sections of code to try to isolate the bug(s).
3. Ask another student(s) for help. Students can also learn significantly by teaching.
4. During help, if there's a whiteboard request, the help session will be time-limited to 5 mins to prevent other students from waiting unreasonably long.
