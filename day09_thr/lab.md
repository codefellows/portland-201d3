# Lab 9

**This is a pair coding lab.**

Please see requirements below.

## Enhance Your Pizza Shop App

Finish and deploy your Pizza Shop app. Style it and make it look more realistic; add store addresses and hours to each store, and tweak colors, borders (thickness, style, color, rounded corners), layout (position, margins, padding), fonts, opacity, etc.

### Minimum requirements for styling
In this lab you get to practice applying many styling rules, and may find your app, as it stands, has a shortage of "spare elements" where you'd like to apply styling. If this is the case for you, please feel free to add new elements to your page (in HTML, or dynamically in JS) so that you can apply the style changes to them.

Alternatively, you can create a separate &quot;About Us&quot; page (e.g., about.html) if that would provide a sufficient number of DOM elements to style.

- Create and use a CSS file for all styling. Avoid using style tags or inline styling in your HTML code.
- Change the position, margin, padding, color, background-color, and opacity of at least one element.
- Render at least one visible border and set its color, thickness, and border-radius.
- Change at least one element whose default display type is "block", and make its display type "inline" and put it next to at least one other element.
- Change at least one element whose default display type is "inline", and make its display type "block".
- Use at least one font from a CDN (such as a Google font).
- Apply a color theme such as ones [HERE](https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest) or [HERE](www.lolcolors.com). Your text can have color from the theme or a color that is not from the theme, but all other elements should contain colors from the theme. Do this for every page in your web app (i.e., index.html, sales-data.html, and any other pages you may have added).

### Extra credit items, up to +2 points each:
- Embed google maps that show each store's location.
- Use a 3rd party layout system such as unsemantic or bootstrap.
- Use CSS3 flexbox to keep elements properly aligned.
- Make your web app &quot;responsive&quot;, i.e., your app should scale/rearrange itself to look good on a cell phone screen, on a tablet screen, and in a (wide) desktop browser window.

## Pair coding
This is a pair coding lab.

By the end of lab, you and your partner will each have her/his own web app complete, fully styled, and **deployed**.

Please follow these steps:

- Do all your work for this lab on a new git branch, and use GitHub PRs at the end to merge the new branch to master. Branch from the work you did for the previous lab (where you added DOM elements that accept user input and created and rendered a new shop object(s)).
- Navigate your app in your repo, while your coding partner dr
ives.
- You can ask your partner to fork your repo and drive on the fork's local clone, or you can add your partner as a collaborator in your repo. Your choice, but specify in your submission which method you picked for your repo.
- When you're done navigating, deploy your finished app to gh_pages so you can show off your app to family and friends just by sending them a URL they can click on; you may want to include the deployment URL in your own resume/portfolio site.
  Help on deployment will be available during lab time, but you need to first make an earnest attempt to follow on-line documentation on deployment (github.com is a good source).
- After navigating, switch roles and drive. Your partner will decide whether you should work as a collaborator or work on a fork. Your partner should submit which method she/he chose.

# Submit
Please submit the following items.
- URL of your deployed app
- URL of your final GitHub PR
- Answers to the following questions:
  - Who was your coding partner?
  - Which method did you use: &quot;fork&quot; or &quot;collaborator&quot;?
  - How much time did you spend on this assignment?
  - How did it go, overall?
  - What observations/questions do you have on what you've learned so far?
