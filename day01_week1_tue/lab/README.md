# Assignment Overview

In class, we wrote a program that accepted user input and, based on that input, displayed messages back to the user. Your assignment involves an extension of that activity, plus completing the reading assignments above.

Note that your grade for this assignment will include the items listed here AND the in-lab activity that you will be doing on Tuesday morning. Instructions for that activity will be provided to you by 8:00a.

# Technical Requirements

- You may do the work in the same files that we used for our class demo today. Because the originals are saved in GitHub, there is no worry to overwriting them.
- Using a total of six JavaScript 'prompt' or 'confirm' statements along the lines of our class demo on Monday, have a user answer six questions.
- The user's response to each question should be stored in a separate variable. Name your variables carefully.
- Using these responses, return an alert to the user that concatenates their response into some kind of reply like we did in class.
- In addition, for each response, create a console.log() message that indicates the user's reponse, as we showed in class.
- In the HTML file, place the six questions within a series of &lt;p&gt; tags so that they are listed on the screen.
- If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away in lab. **Note**: Students using Linux or Windows should coordinate with Al or Jake.

# Submitting Your Assignment

- Go to https://gist.github.com (Links to an external site.)
- In the "Gist description..." field, put your name
- In the "Filename including extension..." field put 'index.html' for your HTML code and then 'app.js' for your JavaScript code (you will be creating two separate Gists).
- Copy-paste your code into the big input field for each Gist.
- Select the button that says "Create secret gist"; copy that link for submission here.
- Do this for each of the HTML and JS portions of your code.
- Add a comment to your Canvas submission with answers to the prompted questions.
