## Code Challenge
Do as many of the following items as you can before 8:10 am:
- Write a web app that uses setInterval() to repeatly trigger a callback that prints "Hello" every second.
- Add a counter that starts at zero on app load, then increments the counter each second and prints the counter value.
- Render the counter value to the DOM and update the DOM each second.
- Render a button that says, "Click me if you can", and use Math.random() and setInterval to change the button's 2-D position in the viewport every 0.5 seconds.
- Add a callback that triggers when the user clicks the "hopping" button, and increment a "score", and render the score in the upper left corner of the viewport.
- Change the button to an image, or give the button a background image.
- Uss CSS to change the mouse cursor to use an image, with x,y coordinates to offset the cursor's "click point"
- Uss CSS to change the mouse cursor to use a different image (w.r.t. the previous requirement) when the cursor's click point is actually hovering over the button.
