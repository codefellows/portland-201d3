# Lab 8

This project is based on a demo of a Code 201 class project; originally built by Scott Schmidt.

## Instructions

Here are several steps you can take, but not necessarily in this order:
- Add a form to the sales-data.html so that user input in the form is passed to the pizza store constructor function, and adds a new store location table to the page.
- Add HTML to create the input form. Use a &lt;fieldset&gt; to visually group the input elements.
- Use your constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: consider what is passed to your constructor when creating object instances!).
- In JS, add event listener and an event handler.
- Validate user input.
-  Divide-and-conquer: code incrementally, and test and a-c-p frequently.
